**Work completed:**

- Finished scaffolding the Electron + TypeScript + React skeleton using the official `electron-vite` `react-ts` template (`@quick-start/create-electron`), copied in manually since the interactive scaffolding CLI couldn't run over a non-TTY shell.
- Stripped the template's demo content (logo, IPC "ping" button, unused CSS/assets) down to a minimal "Piano Tutor" placeholder screen.
- Added Vitest with a smoke test and a `test` script.
- Verified `npm run dev` (launches a real window — confirmed visually), `npm run build`, `npm test`, and `npm run lint` all succeed.
- Committed the scaffold to `chore/project-init`.

**New concepts learned:**

- `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE` — an env var (set by the VSCode/extension-host shell in this environment) that forces any Electron binary to run as plain Node.js instead of launching its GUI. Explains a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'isPackaged')` crash on the first `npm run dev` attempt; clearing the var for the launch command fixed it.
- `electron-vite`'s three-config build (main/preload/renderer each get their own Vite build pass) and why `--no-sandbox`/env quirks show up specifically around spawning the real Electron binary vs. running its JS entry under plain Node.

**Remaining work:**

- Merge `chore/project-init` into `main`.

**Suggested next task:**
Start `feature/microphone-input` — implement mic permission request, audio stream capture via the Web Audio API, and a live level meter/waveform in the renderer (Roadmap Milestone 1).

## 2026-07-02

**Work completed:**

- Reviewed `CLAUDE.md` and confirmed the project is a blank slate (only `CLAUDE.md` + initial commit existed).
- Decided the platform: Electron desktop app, TypeScript, React renderer.
- Decided the initial feature scope: microphone-based pitch detection practice only (no MIDI).
- Created `chore/project-init` branch.
- Wrote initial `docs/Roadmap.md`, `docs/Architecture.md`, `docs/Design-Decisions.md`, `docs/Session-Notes.md`.
- (In progress) Scaffolding the Electron + TypeScript + React skeleton with electron-vite, ESLint/Prettier, and Vitest.

**New concepts learned:**

- Electron's three-process model (main / preload / renderer) and why audio/UI logic must live in the renderer while filesystem access is proxied through preload/main.
- `electron-vite` as the current standard scaffold tool for Electron + TypeScript projects.
- ADR-style decision logging (`Design-Decisions.md`) as a way to record _why_, not just _what_.

**Remaining work:**

- Finish scaffolding: `electron-vite` project structure, ESLint/Prettier config, Vitest with a smoke test.
- Verify `npm run dev`, `npm run build`, `npm test`, `npm run lint` all succeed.
- Merge `chore/project-init` into `main`.

**Suggested next task:**
Start `feature/microphone-input` — implement mic permission request, audio stream capture via the Web Audio API, and a live level meter/waveform in the renderer (Roadmap Milestone 1).
